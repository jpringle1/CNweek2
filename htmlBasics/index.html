    <h2>Why i joined code nation</h2>

    <p>
        I joined code nation because though i am dedicated to becoming a software developer, It's not practical for me to spend 5 years of full time study to get there. The Code Nation master course offers a 12 week route to becoming job ready, with much more practical based study. This is a great way to get to my desired career goals, and to gain valuable experience where a graduate would potentially have less.
    </p>

    <h2>Targets</h2>

    <p>
        My target is to pass the master course, learn as much as possible from it, and take that experience and knowledge into a junior/apprentice software devepment role at the end.
